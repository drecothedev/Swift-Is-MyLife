Grid in SwiftUI

SwiftUI makes it very easy to lay out a grid-style view for iOS applications. I've used grids before when making beatpads for an app I was working on, and now I’m using them to organize different interactive elements within a view.

First, you initialize a `Grid` in your code. This grid will automatically space and arrange all of the `GridRow` structs needed to display the grid’s elements. Check the example below:

```swift
var table = Table()

var body: some View {
    NavigationStack {
        Grid {
            GridRow {
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
                Spacer()
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
                Spacer()
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
            }
            // Dividers rather than spaces
            GridRow {
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
                Divider()
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
                Divider()
                GraphicFullTableView(table: table)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this view, we’re organizing our custom views in a grid layout. You can also add dividers or lines to your views to help separate them more clearly. Additionally, you can customize the alignment and spacing of your grid using parameters:

```swift
Grid(alignment: .bottom, horizontalSpacing: 1, verticalSpacing: 1) {
    // Grid content 
}
```

Performance Note ⚠️

The `Grid` view loads all of its child views immediately. This can be inefficient if your app has a lot to load or is already facing performance issues. In that case, consider using `LazyHGrid` or `LazyVGrid`—especially if your grid is inside a `ScrollView`.
